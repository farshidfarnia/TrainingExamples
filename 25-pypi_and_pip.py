# Visit this page https://pypi.org/ (In this website you can find many awesame packegaes!)
# Go in in this link "https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/" and copy in this line "pip install openpyxl" on the Terminal.
# Then after you install packages on the terminal, open (Project(panel)/External Libraries/Python 3.7/Site-packages)
# Search openpyxl/cell/__init__.py => for example when you add __init__.py to each directory, you create the package!
# So in this case cell has a package (__init__.py) and other files has several modules.
